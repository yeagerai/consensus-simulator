"""
Path generation using depth-first search.

This module generates actual path sequences, complementing the counting
approach with concrete path enumeration.

IMPORTANT: Path length is measured in edges (transitions between nodes),
not in the number of nodes. A path with n nodes has n-1 edges.
This matches the adjacency matrix counting method.
